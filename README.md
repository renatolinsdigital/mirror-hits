# Mirror Hits

An old school mini-game with the idea of a portal, good for practicing reflexes.

Demo: https://renatolinsdigital.github.io/mirror-hits/index.html

## How to play

Use keyboard controls to move the blue board around. Once it hits any falling ball, it will be horizontally teleported to the right side. Once the ball hits that colored object, you score and go to the next level.
